Style Guide
Created 2016-12-22

1. This is a simplified version of Google's Java Style Guide.
   When in doubt, check the online version at
   https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

2. Column Limit of 80 characters.
   Lines longer than 80 characters must be line-wrapped.
   Line-wrapping should happen before operators, including the
   dot operator.
   Other precautions can be made to reduce the length of the line,
   such as removing function and method calls inside of complex 
   statements.

3. Whitespace.
   The only whitespace in the source file should be spaces and newline.
   Indentation level should be 2 spaces.
   All other whitespace characters, such as using them in print statements,
   should be created with letter escape characters (\t, \r etc.)

4. Source file structure.
   Source file consists of, in order;
   1. License or copyright information, if present
   2. Package statement
   3. Import statements
   4. Exactly one top-level class

5. Braces.
   Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even
   when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.
   Use K&R brace style, where there is no line break before the opening
   brace.
   Empty blocks may be precise (ex. function doNothing() {})

6. Comments.
   Comments must be at the top of every class, method, and function.
   Every global variable and instance variable declaration must also be 
   accompanied with a comment.
   Comment large or complex blocks of code.
